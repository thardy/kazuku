/**
 * Each section of the site has its own module. It probably also has
 * submodules, though this boilerplate is too simple to demonstrate it. Within
 * 'src/app/home', however, could exist several additional folders representing
 * additional modules that would then be listed as dependencies of this one.
 * For example, a 'note' section could have the submodules 'note.create',
 * 'note.delete', 'note.edit', etc.
 *
 * Regardless, so long as dependencies are managed correctly, the build process
 * will automatically take take of the rest.
